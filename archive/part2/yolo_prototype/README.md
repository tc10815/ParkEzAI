The Python script here was the original method ChatGPT4 recommended I use to recognize cars in parking spots. It didn't work work very well (see table)

This is also the first place parking spot recommendation and overparking detection was implemented. This file will continue to be referenced as these features are implemented in the Django/React webapp.
