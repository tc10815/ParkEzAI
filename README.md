# ParkEzAI

How people code is changing. Over the last year (2022-2023) AI has become powerful and accessible enough to provide real productivity gains for programmers. This website is an exploration of what coding may be like when AI assistance becomes mainstream.

ParkEz is a school project I'm working on as part of a large team (8 people) which I contributed to the design, but is being implemented by others. The requirements of ParkEz (school project) and ParkEzAI are exactly the same, but the implementation is entirely different. ParkEzAI is coded by one person (me) using mostly code generated by ChatGPT-4, using technologies I'm most familiar with. In terms of implementation, the only similiarty between ParkEz (school project) and ParkEzAI is they both use React as a frontend web technology (but with different design and code). 

<strong>The process for ParkEzAi</strong>
* Write a complex WebApp with ChatGPT-4. 
* My goal is to have at least 80% code written by AI.
* I will include all prompts and the exact responses in a project folder for reference.
* Custom images for assets will be created with DallÂ·E 2. 

<strong>Requirements (identical for ParkEzAi and ParkEz School Project)</strong>
* Experiment in writing a complex webapp with ChatGPT4. 
* My goal is to have at least 80% code written by AI.
* I will include all prompts and the exact response
