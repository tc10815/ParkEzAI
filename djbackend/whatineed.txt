When you first go to the website you have 5 menu links you can click on the
top of the screen: Home, Find Parking, About, Sign Up and Login. Currently,
Home, Find Parking and About are just static pages users see as options
before they log in. 

Clicking Signup allows you to create a new Parking Lot Monitoring or
Advertising account (I will give details on this later). In signup there's
also a button that allows a user to reset the database with sample data
(this is a demo not a real site) and to View All Users (also for demo purposes)

Clicking login can log you on, with 6 different account types. The account
types are:
Lot Operator
Advertiser
Customer Support
Lot Specialist
Advertising Specialist
Accountant

There is also a demo Reset Database with Demonstration Data and View all
accounts button at the bottom of the login page.

Each account type sees different options in links. All account types
have a Update/Delete account page were they can change their information.

Lot specialist can edit and delete Lot Operator accounts on a page,
Advertising Specialist can edit and delete Advertiser accounts. Customer
support can edit and delete both.

There's a ticket system. Advertisers and Lot operators can create tickets.
Advertising Specialist can see, edit and delete Advertiser tickets. Lot 
specialist can see, edit and delete Lot Operator tickets. Customer
support can edit and delete both.

Finally, Accountant has a page where they can create, edit and delete 
all employee account types (Customer Support, Lot Specialist, Advertising
Specialist, Accountant)
